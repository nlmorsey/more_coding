1. Break down line by line what each expression does:
    a. Break down each expression as if you were the computer evaluating it.
    b. Add comments on every line explaining what each expression and symbol does.
2. It is important to differentiate between:
    a. Declaring what arguments a method takes
    b. Giving the method arguments
    c. Because normally you "give" a method arguments when you call it
    d. And you "define" or "declare" a method's arguments when you define it
3. There are two actions you can take with a given method:
    a. You can "call" it, which executes the body of the method with the data provided it via its arguments.
    b. You can "define" a method, which is where you name it, say which arguments it is allowed to take, and provide it with a body of code to execute when called.
4. Challenges:
    a. Can you make it print three arguments instead of two?
    b. Can you do it without the splat operator?
5. Work on bigger things, as opposed the small things
    a. Get new data to refine your mental model
    b. Don't get hung up on vocabulary as opposed to seeing what happens with code.
