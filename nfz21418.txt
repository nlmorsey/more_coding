Reading data from a data source, manipulating it, and writing back to a new or the same data source is a pretty important skill to have. 
Files (CSV, Excel) read write is one way to do that that is pretty universal. Databases are another.
What I am hoping to see...
...once youâ€™ve gotten the hang of writing methods and tracing their inputs and outputs up and down through the running code...
...is seeing you reading and writing data from data sources.
