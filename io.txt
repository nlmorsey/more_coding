I couldn't find method 'read' or method 'seek' when I tried searching for 'file."

I knew that the argument was a file. I knew because I used 'p' inside of the method, e.g. 'p f' or 'p f.class'

It returned: 'File' and 'test.txt'

So I thought that ruby docs would have documentation about 'file' methods 'read' and 'seek'

Nope. The correct place to look is Class:IO

Ruby Docs says: "The IO class is the basis for all input and output in Ruby. Many of the examples in this section use the File class, the only standard subclass of IO."

"The global constant ARGF (also accessible as $<) provides an IO-like stream which allows access to all files mentioned on the command line (or STDIN if no files are mentioned). 
    ARGF#path and its alias ARGF#filename are provided to access the name of the file currently being read."
    
Zee says, "File inherits from IO
(Inheritance is when a class has some of it's methods defined by another class, generally called the "parent" class)
if you go here: http://www.rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/File
You'll see a section that says 'Inherits"
(use ctrl+f to find it)
and it will link back to the class File inherits from"

.read([length [, outbuf]]} => string, outbuf, or nil
f.read(16)

What is outbuf?
*It is optional
*It is an argument
*It must reference a String
*The String will receive the data
*The outbuf will contain only the received data after the method called
*The outbuf will contain only the above, even if it's not empty at the beginning

What is length?
*They are bytes from the I/O stream
*It must be a non-negative integer or 'nil'
*If a positive integer, reads in binary
*Returns 'nil' or a string same as length bytes
*If 'length' is omitted, it reads until EOF
*If 'length' is zero, it returns ""
